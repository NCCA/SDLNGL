# SDLNGL

![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/SDLNGL.png)

This is the simplest SDL / NGL demo using a basic SDL2.0 window and core profile OpenGL context

Ensure that SDL2 has been installed using vcpkg. and CMake will search and include the correct packages. 

To use under windows ensure that SDL2 is installed via vcpkg for a 64 bit build

```
./vcpkg.exe install sdl2:x64-windows
```
